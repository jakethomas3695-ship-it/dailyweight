# dailyweight
PWA for daily body comp &amp; nutrition tracking with self-calibrating TDEE projections. Logs weight, measurements, steps, cardio &amp; macros — estimates BMR via Katch-McArdle, derives TDEE from step-banded multipliers, then calibrates against actual weight change to project 5 &amp; 10-week outcomes. Fully local, no backend.
